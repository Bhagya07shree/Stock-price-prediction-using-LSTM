## **ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using LSTM**
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical stock data.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to its dynamic and volatile nature. Traditional models struggle with sequential
data dependencies, which is where **LSTM** networks come into play. This project:
- Uses historical **Open**, **High**, **Low**, and **Close** prices
- Preprocesses and normalizes the data for training
- Builds an LSTM model to learn patterns in sequential data
- Predicts future stock prices based on past trends
- Visualizes the actual vs. predicted prices using an interactive dashboard

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** â€“ Deep learning framework
- **Pandas / NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** â€“ For charting
- **Streamlit** â€“ To build a user-friendly web app interface
